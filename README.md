Hostyle Theme For Bash-It
=========================

This is my personal theme for [bash-it](https://github.com/revans/bash-it). It's a mixture of simplicity and functionality.

For a git folder it looks like:
```
[user@host current_directory [±] git_branch git_sha ✗]$
```

For a non-git folder it looks like:
```
[user@host current_directory]$
```

The git information only appears when you are in a git folder. Follow the instructiones below to install it.

Installation
============

```
git clone git://github.com/satanas/bash-it-theme.git ~/bash-it-theme
ln -s ~/bash-it-theme/hostyle ~/.bash_it/themes/
```

Suggestions are welcome
